# ML  

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that are designed for a variety of analytical projects. Each script showcases the use of powerful data analysis and machine learning libraries to address different problems and visualize results.  

## Libraries Used  

The following Python libraries were utilized in these projects:  

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **numpy**: Numerical computing.  
- **matplotlib**: Visualization and plotting.  
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and utilities.  
- **torch**: Deep learning and neural networks.
- **requests**: Fetching data from a RESTful API or GraphQL API.
    
## Features  

- Each script is organized with `# %%` markers for executable sections. This allows users to execute the code line by line in any compatible code editor, such as:  
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
  - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  
  - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)  
- The projects include a variety of tasks, such as:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  - Machine learning model training and evaluation.  
  - Visualization of data and results.  

## How to Use  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/vmose/ml.git  
   cd python_notebooks
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Open any .py file in your preferred code editor. Use the # %% markers to execute each section of the script.
