# ML  

This repository features a collection of Python scripts tailored for diverse analytical projects. Each script demonstrates the application of robust data analysis and machine learning libraries to solve various challenges and visualize the outcomes effectively. 

## Libraries Used  

The scripts leverage the following Python libraries for efficient data processing, analysis, and modeling: 

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.  
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations and plots.  
- **seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization.  
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and utilities.  
- **torch**: For building and training deep learning models.  
- **requests**: For fetching data from RESTful or GraphQL APIs. 
    
## Features  

- Each script is organized with `# %%` markers for executable sections. This allows users to execute the code line by line in any compatible code editor, such as:  
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
  - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  
  - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)  
- The projects include a variety of tasks, such as:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  - Machine learning model training and evaluation.  
  - Visualization of data and results.  

## How to Use  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/vmose/ml.git  
   cd python_notebooks
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Open any .py file in your preferred code editor. Use the # %% markers to execute each section of the script.
